# XSA - (X Sentiment Analysis) 📊🐦

## Overview

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involving the classification of tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. This project focuses on creating a user-friendly GUI application for sentiment analysis using custom-built machine learning algorithms.

## Key Learning Objectives 🚀

- **GUI Development:** Create an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Tkinter.
- **Custom Sentiment Analysis:** Implement sentiment analysis from scratch, avoiding pre-built NLP or ML libraries.
- **Hands-on Machine Learning:** Gain practical experience with machine learning algorithms for text classification.
- **Python Proficiency:** Enhance Python programming skills through real-world application development.
- **Collaborative Project:** Work on a group project in a university setting, fostering teamwork and learning dynamics.
