## Context

This internship took place from the 16th of April 2021 to the 26th of June 2021. It's part of the end of term assignement at the Universitary Institute of Technology in Vannes.

I've had the opportunity to do my internship in the Accenture Technology center in Nantes, FR. I was part of the research lab team "Liquid Studio". My tutor at Accenture was Mr. Vallentin Villedieu, Ingeneer in Artifical Intelligence (Ecole Centrale Nantes).

The rest of the context, as well as my work during the internship is described in the pdf report.

**WIP : i'm currently working on translating the whole document in english. For the moment it's only available in french which was the main language for the report**
