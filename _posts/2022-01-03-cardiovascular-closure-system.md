## Context
This project was made during the second semester of the year 2021-2022, supervised by Mrs Beatrice GUYOMAR'CH (CHU Nantes).
The language used is SAS and the paper was redacted in french.

## Objectives
This project had 2 main goals:
- comparing the vascular closing system's efficiency throughout a series of randomized patients.
- proving the link between the vascular closure system used and the success of the operation (H0 : FEMOSEAL system works better than PROGLIDE).
All scripts are annexed to the paper.
