## Abstract

This project aims to link two of the things i\'m very interested in :
artificial intelligence and robotics. In this paper I will use the
openAI Gym python library and one of it\'s environment : Bipedal Walker
(Box2D environments).

The final goal is to have a pseudo-robotic agent that can walk from point A to point B. The agent will "learn" how to walk using the process of reinforcement learning (Deep Q-learning in our case and not only Q-learning). The agent is defined as pseudo-robotic because accroding to the definition : " A robot is a machine that resembles a living creature in being capable of moving independently (as by walking or rolling on wheels) and performing complex actions (such as grasping and moving objects) " - Merriam-Webster (<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/robot>). So pseudo-robotic because it's a simulation of this machine.

In this post I will go though multiple topics :

-   Short definition of reinforcement learning
-   Description of the environment and the agent
-   Explaining DDPG algorithm
-   Implementation of the environment and simulation

You are welcome to go and see the OpenAI Gym documentation here :

## Reinforcement Learning - what you need to know

The history of reinforcement learning (RL) has two main threads, both
long and rich, that were pursued independently before intertwining in
modern reinforcement learning. One thread concerns learning by trial and
error and started in the psychology of animal learning. This thread runs
through some of the earliest work in artificial intelligence and led to
the revival of reinforcement learning in the early 1980s. The other
thread concerns the problem of optimal control and its solution using
value functions and dynamic programming. For the most part, this thread
did not involve learning. Although the two threads have been largely
independent, the exceptions revolve around a third, less distinct thread
concerning temporal-difference methods such as used in the tic-tac-toe
example. All of the threads came together in the late 1980's to produce
the modern field of reinforcement learning as we know it.

**Today, reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment.**

The underlying maths in RL is based on Markovian Decision Processes (MDP) :

-   a set of environments and agent state S;
-   a set of actions A on the agent;
-   the probability of transition from a state s to a state s'
-   the immediate reward after transition from s to s' with action a.

The purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an
optimal, or nearly-optimal, policy that maximizes the "reward
function" or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates
from the immediate rewards.

This concludes our short recap of what you need to know in RL.

## Description of the Environment and the agent

This is a simple 4-joint walker robot environment. There are two
versions :

-   Normal, with slightly uneven terrain
-   Hardcore, with ladder, stumps, pitfalls

To solve the normal version, you need to get 300 points in 1600 time
steps. To solve the hardcore version, you need 300 points in 2000 time
steps.

### Action Space

Actions are motor speed valued in the [-1, 1] range for each of the 4
joints at both hips and knees

### Observation Space

State consists of hull angle speed, angular velocity, horizontal speed,
vertical speed, position of joints and joints angular speed, legs
contact with ground, and 10 lidar rangefinder measurements. There are no
coordinates in the state vector.

### Reward

Reward is given for moving forward, totaling 300+ points up to the far
end. If the robot falls, it gets -100. Applying motor torque costs a
small amount of points. A more optimal agent will get a better score.

### Starting State

The walker starts standing at the left end of the terrain with the hull
horizontal, and both legs in the same position with a slight knee angle.

### Episode Termination

The episode will terminate if the hull gets in contact with the ground
or if the walker exceeds the right end of the terrain length.


## Explaining the DDPG algorithm

Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is an algorithm which
concurrently learns a Q-function and a policy. It uses off-policy data
and the Bellman equation to learn the Q-function, and uses the
Q-function to learn the policy.

This approach is closely connected to Q-learning, and is motivated the
same way: if you know the optimal action-value function then in any
given state, the optimal action can be found by solving :

a*(s) = argmax_a Q*(s,a).

DDPG interleaves learning an approximator to Q*(s,a) with learning an
approximator to a*(s), and it does so in a way which is specifically
adapted for environments with continuous action spaces. But what does it
mean that DDPG is adapted specifically for environments with continuous
action spaces? It relates to how we compute the max over actions in
max_a Q*(s,a).

### The Q-learning side of DDPG

**Trick One** : Replay Buffers. All standard algorithms for training a
deep neural network to approximate Q*(s,a) make use of an experience
replay buffer. This is the set D of previous experiences. In order for
the algorithm to have stable behavior, the replay buffer should be large
enough to contain a wide range of experiences, but it may not always be
good to keep everything.

If you only use the very-most recent data, you will overfit to that and
things will break; if you use too much experience, you may slow down
your learning. This may take some tuning to get right.

**Trick Two** : Target Networks. Q-learning algorithms make use of
target networks. The term

r + gamma (1 - d) max_a' Q_phi(s',a')

is called the target, because when we minimize the MSBE (Mean squared
Bellman error) loss, we are trying to make the Q-function be more like
this target.

Problematically, the target depends on the same parameters we are trying
to train: phi. This makes MSBE minimization unstable. The solution is to
use a set of parameters which comes close to phi, but with a time
delay---that is to say, a second network, called the target network,
which lags the first.

### Policy Learning of DDPG

Policy learning in DDPG is fairly simple. We want to learn a
deterministic policy mu_theta(s) which gives the action that maximizes
Q_phi(s,a). Because the action space is continuous, and we assume the
Q-function is differentiable with respect to action, we can just perform
gradient ascent (with respect to policy parameters only) to solve the
maximization problem.


## Implementation of the Environment and simulation

**Problem Statement**

Teach the bipedal robot to walk from a starting point to end without
falling, and maximize the reward. Reward if given form oving forward
(total +300 pts). If the robot falls, the sum of the rewards will
decrease from 100 pts. Applying motor torque costs a small amount of
points.

#### Common Algorithms

-   **Deterministic policy** maps state to action without uncertainty.
    It happens when you have a deterministic environment like a chess
    table. Stochastic policy outputs a probability distribution over
    actions in a given state.

-   A **model of the environment** means a function which predicts state
    transitions and rewards. **Model-free RL** algorithms are those that
    make no effort to learn the underlying dynamics that govern how an
    agent interacts with the environment.

-   **Policy gradient** algorithms utilize a form of policy iteration:
    they evaluate the policy, and then follow the policy gradient to
    maximize performance.

-   In **Q learning**, We constantly update a Q-Table, which is a lookup
    table where we calculate the maximum expected future rewards for
    action at each state. Basically, this table will guide us to the
    best action at each state.

-   **Off-policy** algorithms generally employ a separate behavior
    policy that is independent of the policy being improved upon; the
    behavior policy is used to simulate trajectories. A key benefit of
    this separation is that the behavior policy can operate by sampling
    all actions, whereas the estimation policy can be deterministic

-   **The TD error** signal is excellent at compounding the variance
    introduced by your bad predictions over time. It is highly suggested
    to use a replay buffer to store the experiences of the agent during
    training, and then randomly sample experiences to use for learning
    in order to break up the temporal correlations within different
    training episodes. This technique is known as experience replay.

-   **Actor-critic** combines the benefits of both approaches from
    policy-iteration method as PG and value-iteration method as
    Q-learning. The network will estimate both a value function V(s)
    (how good a certain state is to be in) and a policy Ï€(s).

-   The **critic**'s output is simply the estimated Q-value of the
    current state and of the action given by the actor. The
    deterministic policy gradient theorem provides the update rule for
    the weights of the actor network. The critic network is updated from
    the gradients obtained from the TD error signal.

-   **DDPG algorithm** is an actor-critic algorithm; it primarily uses
    two neural networks, one for the actor and one for the critic. These
    networks compute action predictions for the current state and
    generate a temporal-difference (TD) error signal each time step. The
    input of the actor network is the current state, and the output is a
    single real value representing an action chosen from a continuous
    action space.

## Conclusion

Using DDPG algorithm, it is possible to train a bipedal robot to walk. With just 2000 episodes of training our agent learned to walk considerably well. We've seen some ups and down so there's a ot to do on tweaking the hyperparameters to have a constant improvement in terms of rewards. This Actor-Critic interaction is similar to how GAN's work (Generative Adversarial Networks). A post will soon be posted on this subject.

## Next steps

-   Apply the model to the hardcore environment
-   Apply the model to a real robot
