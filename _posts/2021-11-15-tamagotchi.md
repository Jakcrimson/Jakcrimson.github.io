## Context

This project was conducted during the first semester of the uni. year 2021-2022. It's a remake of the famous "egg-watch" games called "Tamagotchi". We've called it "Keneil" ("Friend" in old Brittany language).

This game was developped in Java, all of the assets and artistic work was done by the group. The music used is DMCA-free.

The different objectives of this project are to develop skills in the following areas:
- Analysis

All the documents have been written in french as well as the javadoc.
