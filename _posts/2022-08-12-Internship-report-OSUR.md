## Context

This internship took place from the 21st of January 2022 to the 20th of February 2022. It's part of the ST01 module at the UTC, FR.
The report was redacted by me during the internship. I was advised by the internship tutors on the contents and the form of the report.

This report presents the work undertaken during a 1 month internship with the "Plateforme LiDAR" team at the
"Observatoire des Sciences de lâ€™Univers de Rennes" (OSUR) under the supervision of Mathilde Letard and Paul
Leroy.
