# Project: UMAP vs t-SNE üìä

## Overview:
This project compares Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for dimension reduction tasks. UMAP, a formidable competitor to t-SNE, excels in preserving both local and global structure in high-dimensional data.

## How UMAP Works:
UMAP constructs a fuzzy topological representation, optimizing an objective function to balance local and global structure preservation. It achieves this through graph construction and embedding techniques.

## Testing and Comparison:
We'll test UMAP and t-SNE on diverse datasets, evaluating visualization quality, structure preservation, and computational efficiency. The comparison aims to highlight each algorithm's strengths and weaknesses across different data types.

## Impact of Parameters:
Exploring parameters like number of neighbors and distance metrics, we'll assess their impact on UMAP's performance.
