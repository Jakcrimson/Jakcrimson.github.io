## Context
This assignment is part of the ISC4 course at the Université Technologique de Compiègne, France.

## Objectives
This project aims to familiarize students with the study of dynamic systems inspired from real-world
problems (autonomous car insertion on a highway, consideration of sensor measurements uncertainties etc.).
The project was implemented on the Octave GUI (substitute for MatLab). The answers to the questions
will be divided in two parts :
  • The theoretical part, finding and understanding the strategy
  • The practical part, implementing the strategy on Octave GUI
