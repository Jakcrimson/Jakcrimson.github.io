## Context

This internship took place from the 1st of May 2022 to the 12th of August 2022. It's part of the end of term assignement at the University of South Britanny in Vannes.

I've had the opportunity to do my internship in the LETG LAB in Rennes, FR. My tutor was Mrs. Javiera Castillo, PhD in Semantic Segmentation (Currently Post-Doc in Switzerland).

The rest of the context, as well as my work during the internship is described in the pdf report.
