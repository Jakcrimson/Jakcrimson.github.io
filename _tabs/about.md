### Hello There 👋

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=jakcrimson&color=green&style=for-the-badge)

- 🔭 **I am enrolled in a PhD Program at INRIA, Rennes. The PhD is financed by the AID (Defense Innovation Agency) and is a consortium between the DGA (French General Direction of Armament), the University of Angers and the University of Rennes**.
- 🪐 **I graduated my Masters of Science in Machine Learning from the University of Lille (top 3%)**.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help.
- 📈 I am getting more and more interested in how quantitative finance and signal analysis both boosted with Artificial Intelligence can impact today's economy and geopolitical interactions.
